# HelperNode 2.0

This is the fork where work is being done on refactoring the HelperNode to use only containers. The following are the guiding principals:

* Declarative approach to all services
  * The `vars.yaml` (which will be renamed to `helpernode.yaml`) will be the "source of truth"
  * ALL services will be based on what is in this file.
  * Changes are to be made to the manifest file directly if a change is needed.
* All services will be independet of each other
  * All services will be self contained
  * No dependecies between services where possible (exceptions only when absolutley needed)
  * The user can use all or just a subset of services
  * oc/openshift-install/helm utilites are stored in a container but can be pulled into the node
* All logic for each containerized service will be in the `startup.sh` file
* Client utility (`helpernodectl`) should be used to interact with services/utilites
* No dependency to local storage
  * Containers should NOT rely on storage on the Host system (i.e. **no** mounting/binding like `-v /hostdir:/containerdir`)
  * Host using artifacts in containers is okay
  * `helpernode.yaml` is/should-be the only dependency on disk (besides the utility)
* Garbage in/Garbage out
* Users should not have to deal with contianers directly
* "HelperPod" should be versioned all the way through
  * it is also tied to the version of OpenShift
  * Ability to specify other OpenShift versions will be made availbe, but will NOT be supported by this project
    * i.e. if you fill out a github issue about this, it will be "closed/won't fix"

# Development

"HelperPod" should be considered pre-alpha and every change should be considered a "breaking change" until the official 2.0 release.


# HelperPod

You may be asking

> Why do I see "HelperPod" everywhere.

It's just a codename. Originally, the plan was to run the helpernode with `podman play kube` and that's where the name comes from. This refactor is still evolving so stay tuned for more info.
